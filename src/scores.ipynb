    "To determine wether a DC-Cell line experiment is antagonistic or synergistic, we take the scores values an let each take a vote. If the score is > 0, then it votes to synergism. Otherwise it votes to antagonism.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to start out with a simple GNN, that has a link from DC to disease if and only if the combination is synergistic. In order to further push the simplicity of the model, we want to start out using only one score type for determining antagonism or synergism.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this EDA, I will try to answer the question: which is the most reliable score type among _Bliss_, _HSA_, _ZIP_, and _Loewe_ in the experiments?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, I will check the hit rate of each score type and analyze it."
